Treasure Hunt Generator:
A web-based framework using Python and HTML/JavaScript to create treasure hunt games/quizzes for different topics/courses.
Instructors can prepare the set of questions and answers in an Excel file (in a specific format), upload it to the web interface, along with image files (if any), fill in a few details (such as name of the quiz, mode â€“ classroom discussion or test mode, cryptogram string for the final question, author name, date, etc.), and on the click of a button, their treasure hunt (PDF of slides) is ready!
